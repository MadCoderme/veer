# veer
An upgraded SPA rendering method that focuses on performance and SEO.

## Why veer?
SPA is a popular choice when it comes to building javascript based web applications. Low cost and ease in development attract many developers to roll up SPA. While vue.js is fast at its core, common problems still exist.

- SPA is loaded at client side. What this means is that all the bundles need to be loaded before anything can be shown. Even with code splitting, this badly affects initial loading time as the project gets larger
